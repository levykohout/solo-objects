# Solo - Objects Activity

## Object Activity
The purpose of this activity is to test our newly acquired knowledge on the topic in Javascript Objects. The code instructions were:
>Pick your favorite team (sports or otherwise) and create an object with 10 properties
>and a function that pretty prints the values (prints them in a human readable form, example below).

I choose Minnesota Vikings to model as an object because although I am not born in Minnesota, my husband and 3 kids are born here and we will be together cheering for this team :-).


## Output
The output in my application looks like this.

 and its fightsong is Skol Vikings. They are known to have the biggest rivalry with Green Bay Packers.
